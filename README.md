# ðŸ›’ Dart E-Commerce CLI

This project is an e-commerce system running on a terminal, built in the Dart language.
This project makes it easy to learn and practice the important things of Dart â€” classes, functions, constructors, file reading and writing (file I/O), and modular programming. And all of this can be learned by creating a real-life e-commerce application.
